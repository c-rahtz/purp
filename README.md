purp
===

pup is a an in-progress theme built from the _s WordPress theme template. I've currently built it to meet the needs of my blog, but I'm also working to make it generally usable for any WordPress site. Feel free to clone and submit pull requests with any updates you care to make. Very little styling is exposed in the WordPress customizer at this time, but colors can be customized by editing the LESS color variables and re-compiling the stylesheet.
